# Minimum-Spanning-Tree-C
A school assignment in which we simulated Prim's algorithm n C to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) given a graph and a root  
  
Every line of your text file should be a single edge  
An edge consists of two vertices and a weight in this order: vertex1 vertex2 weight  
An example graph file is given as graph.in  
  
To use:  
Compile it in the holding directory with "make"  
Then run with the parameters "./MST graph_file root"  
An example call: "./MST graph.in A"
